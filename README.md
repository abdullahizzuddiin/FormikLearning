# Formik Learning
This repo is intended to show off learning of Form Management Library. We will learn [Formik](https://formik.org/), [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for building a form in convenience way. 

This repo contains only three branches: `master`, `finish-formik`, and `finish-react-hook-form`.

### `master` Branch
`master` branch hold a initial files. Not a literally "initial files" tho. But:
- Installed [react-native-elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) and [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) to help me build a nice UI,
- Created Login Page and Register Page,
- Add local state, validation function, and submit handler,
- All of them worked successfully.


### `finish-formik` Branch
`finish-formik` branch hold the final version of the Formik Learning Lesson. I implemented Formik and Yup to Login and Register Page.

### `finish-react-hook-form` Branch
`finish-react-hook-form` branch hold the final version of the React Hook Form Learning Lesson. I implemented React Hook Form and Yup to Login and Register Page.

### Learning
I tried to document my step building this project as clean as possible. You can follow my steps by looking at the commit history. Just open commit history page to see that based on the branch.

You can read my written-tutorial on [Medium (Formik)](https://dinjudin.medium.com/mudah-membuat-form-dengan-formik-x-yup-di-react-native-f1ea9399bd91). But, if you are visual people, you can follow my video-tutorial on [Youtube (Formik)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b1aL6fp9r0)
