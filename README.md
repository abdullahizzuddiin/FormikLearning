# Formik Learning
This repo is intended to show off learning of Formik. We will learn [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for building a form in convenience way. 

This repo contains only two branches: `master` and `finish`.

### `master` Branch
`master` branch hold a initial files. Not a literally "initial files" tho. But:
- Installed [react-native-elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) and [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) to help me build a nice UI,
- Created Login Page and Register Page,
- Add local state, validation function, and submit handler,
- All of them worked successfully.


### `finish` Branch
`finish` branch hold the final version of the Formik Learning Lesson. I implemented Formik and Yup to Login and Register Page.

### Learning
I tried to document this project as clean as possible. You can follow my step in building this project by looking at the commit history. Just open commit history page to see that.

You can read my written-tutorial on [Medium](#). But, if you are visual people, you can follow my video-tutorial on [Youtube](#)

Keep Coding!
